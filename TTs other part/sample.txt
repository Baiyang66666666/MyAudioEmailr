Dear all,

2023 Applications now open! (Deadline 4 March)

The White Rose BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) in Mechanistic Biology brings together world-class molecular and cellular bioscience centres at the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield and York, offering PhD studentships in cutting-edge molecular, genetic and biochemical research. We are committed to creating a more diverse and inclusive environment within our postgraduate research programme. As such, we have created the Diverse Talent Scholarship scheme as part of the White Rose Doctoral Training Programme, which aims to provide support for candidates with outstanding potential, from diverse backgrounds, especially those who may not have previously considered a PhD as a viable option.
